# langgames
A page that does a few language games. Pig Latin, Tutnese, a few others.

Generally, the big box on top is where you put your plain text, and the translation comes out in the bottom. Games are as follows:
Encryption - "Encrypts" the text by adding the place in the character string of the character to it, based on either vowel or consonant, i.e. "A test" becomes "E xayb" (the next vowel after "A" is "E", and it's the first character, going along the consonants by three from "t" gives "x", and so on). The decryption does the opposite.

Pig Latin - Translates a senctence into pig latin. I follow the "-yay" version, i.e., a word that begins with a vowel gets a "yay, rather than just an "ay".

Blinkenlights - Takes the binary from of each letter in plaintext, and makes a set of "lights" in a table, and scrolls them as needed.

Tutnese - Uses the tutnese language game. Each consonant has a syllable that it gets replaced with.

Inflationary - Victor Borge's inflationary language. Makes everything one higher. I.e. "To be or not to be", becomes "Three be or not three be."

Deflate - Gives the base 64 encoding of a gzipped string.

Bar Code - Creates a bar code of the given string. Uses code from David S. Tufts (davidscotttufts.com)

URI - URI encodes a string.

English Abjad - Removes all the vowels from a string (as in an abjad).

Polybius Square - Translate a string using the rules of a Polybius Square.

Polybius Square - Encoded - As above, but uses the "Encryption" function (above) first.

Image Code - Groups characters into groups of three and creates a block of color in the output field at the bottom.

Image Code - Alphanumeric Only - Skips the non-alphanumeric characters, otherwise, as above. This version makes for fewer overall colors, so makes the output easier to "read".
